1)How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was interesting  to leran a new way of finding the diffrence in files with large code. I am going to use it.

2)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You will work faster and lose less time at reviewing a whole file.

3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?


pros:you do it when you find it right and not whenever the system thinks is time to create it.

cons: we may create too many not really neccessary commit. 

4)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


5)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You use git log to view all the commit changes that were made during the work.

6)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can find easily with  the help of version control where the bug is and change it.

7)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want start doing any project and use git.
